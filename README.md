Welcome to **Pocahontas-p2p**, a bold, open-source protocol to revolutionize peer-to-peer (P2P) value exchange! We're building a decentralized system where anyone can trade Bitcoin (BTC) over the Lightning Network for fiat-based purchases (think Amazon, eBay, and beyond). No middlemen, no hefty fees‚Äîjust pure P2P freedom powered by Nostr relays for privacy and AI agents for smart matching. Ready to reshape how we shop and trade? Join us!

## üöÄ Vision
Imagine this: You want to buy a bike on eBay but only have BTC. With Pocahontas-p2p, you post an offer via Nostr, pledging BTC via a Lightning hold invoice. An AI agent matches you with someone who has fiat, completes the purchase, and gets your BTC‚Äîtrustlessly, privately, and with zero platform fees. This is *your* protocol, built by the community, for the community.

- **Decentralized**: No central app holding your funds‚Äîpure P2P via Nostr and Lightning.
- **Private**: Nostr relays and encrypted DMs keep your data yours.
- **Smart**: AI agents automate matching and escrow, making trades fast and fair.
- **User-Driven**: Open source, with benefits (like micro-rewards in sats) flowing to you.

Inspired by projects like Mostro and Bisq, we're taking P2P to the next level with AI and community governance.


## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Post an Offer**: User A (BTC payer) broadcasts a trade request (e.g., "$100 Amazon purchase, offeringing"

"Not your keys, not your coins. Not your node, not your rules."

Enabling truly peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading, one Lightning transaction at a time. ‚ö°
