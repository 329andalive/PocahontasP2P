Pocahontas-p2p 🌟

Welcome to Pocahontas-p2p, a bold, open-source protocol to revolutionize peer-to-peer (P2P) value exchange! We're building a decentralized system where anyone can trade Bitcoin (BTC) over the Lightning Network for fiat-based purchases (think Amazon, eBay, and beyond). No middlemen, no hefty fees—just pure P2P freedom powered by Nostr relays for privacy and AI agents for smart matching. Ready to reshape how we shop and trade? Join us!

🚀 Vision

Imagine this: You want to buy a bike on eBay but only have BTC. With Pocahontas-p2p, you post an offer via Nostr, pledging BTC via a Lightning hold invoice. An AI agent matches you with someone who has fiat, completes the purchase, and gets your BTC—trustlessly, privately, and with zero platform fees. This is your protocol, built by the community, for the community.





Decentralized: No central app holding your funds—pure P2P via Nostr and Lightning.



Private: Nostr relays and encrypted DMs keep your data yours.



Smart: AI agents automate matching and escrow, making trades fast and fair.



User-Driven: Open source, with benefits (like micro-rewards in sats) flowing to you.

Inspired by projects like Mostro and Bisq, we're taking P2P to the next level with AI and community governance.

🛠️ How It Works





Post an Offer: User A (BTC payer) broadcasts a trade request (e.g., "$100 Amazon purchase, offering BTC +10%") to Nostr relays.



AI Matching: Decentralized AI agents scan offers, match with User B (fiat payer) based on amount, reputation, and preferences.



Trustless Escrow: Lightning hold invoices lock BTC until User B delivers proof (e.g., order receipt).



Settle & Rate: Trade completes, users zap reputation scores, and community rewards flow.

🌍 Why Pocahontas?

Named for the spirit of exploration and connection, Pocahontas-p2p bridges crypto and fiat worlds, empowering users to trade value directly. Whether you're a Bitcoin maxi, a privacy advocate, or just want cheaper online shopping, this is for you.

📋 Current Status

We're in early development—think of this as the spark of a big idea! Current goals:





Define Nostr event kinds for P2P offers (NIP draft in progress).



Build prototype clients in JS/Rust for Nostr and Lightning integration.



Recruit devs, testers, and dreamers to shape the protocol.

Check Issues for tasks or Discussions to brainstorm!

🧑‍💻 Get Involved

We're open source and community-driven—everyone’s welcome! Here’s how to jump in:





Contribute Code: Fork the repo, pick a "good first issue," and submit a pull request. We need Rust/JS devs for Nostr, Lightning, and AI agents.



Test & Feedback: Try our prototypes (coming soon) and report bugs.



Spread the Word: Post about us on Nostr (#PocahontasP2P) or X @LastBlock21



Join Discussions: Share ideas in our GitHub Discussions or Nostr community.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed guidelines. No coding skills? No problem—designers, writers, and testers are vital too!

🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)





Nostr: Relays for decentralized offer broadcasting (NIP-01, NIP-04).



Lightning Network: Hold invoices/HTLCs for trustless escrow.



AI Agents: Decentralized ML (e.g., Llama, TensorFlow.js) for matching.



Languages: JavaScript (nostr-tools), Rust (rust-lightning).



Optional: BitVM for advanced contract logic, DAO for governance.

📅 Roadmap





Q4 2025: Submit NIP draft for P2P exchange events.



Q1 2026: Prototype client with basic Nostr/Lightning integration.



Q2 2026: AI agent MVP for matching offers.



Q3 2026: Community testing and first real trades on testnet.
